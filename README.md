# JS-Jeopardy-
A simple jeopardy game based on javascript and HTML. It uses https://jservice.io/ for the questions and answers

I based it on this youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYMBkayHmUo and added more animations and music to it. I manage to put them all in one file too.
I made this as I took an elective on javascript during my third year of college, the base of it was made as one of the requirements so I just continued it
Make sure to download the mp3 file or simply add your own if you want to change it.
Hope you enjoy :)
