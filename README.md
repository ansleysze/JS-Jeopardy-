# JS-Jeopardy-
A simple jeopardy game based on javascript and HTML.

I based it on this youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYMBkayHmUo and added more animations and music to it
I made this as I took an elective on javascript during my third year of college.
Make sure to download the mp3 file or simply add your own if you want to change it.
Hope you enjoy :)
